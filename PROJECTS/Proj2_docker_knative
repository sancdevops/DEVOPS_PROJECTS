Opsly is currently looking for a DevOps engineer to help with creating a self-hosted version of our hosted SaaS www.opslycloud.com. We're currently running

1 Frontend application with Elm
1 Backend application with Go
Kafka
Knative
Vault
PostgreDB

All in GCP in Kubernetes helm charts. We need to create 1 docker image so customers can install and run the app locally or in the Cloud instead of using our SaaS.
