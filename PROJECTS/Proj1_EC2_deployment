3 tasks or requirements:

1. I have steps for installing Milvus Database (UI + Backend) on EC2, however, only the UI doesn't seem to be working from the browser. I need someone to revisit the configs and address the gaps.

2.
i. Also, I need end-2-end automation (need to automatically execute #1) of deploying Milvus on EC2 machine using Terraform
ii. Ansible playbooks (redeployment of code, incase).

3. After deployment, I need the EC2's Public IP to be programmatically mapped to the DNS (Cloudflare is on my mind, alternatives are also welcome)

FYI, the list is prioritised and it needs to be a complete solution with minimal supervision.
